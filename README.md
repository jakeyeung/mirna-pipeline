# miRNA pipeline

### June 6 2014

This is a repository containing scripts used to process miRNA data. 

Directory `mirna_analysis` contains python and R scripts used for processing miRNA.
These scripts should be somewhat general and can be used for other miRNA datasets or 
even gene expression data sets.

Main directory contains `qsub` scripts I wrote to run scripts in `mirna_analysis` (or
just programs such as bwa.

`submission_scripts` directory contains executable scripts that qsub can call.
